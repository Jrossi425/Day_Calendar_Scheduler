## Description

Week 5 Challenge: To create a working Work Day Scheduler. The application allows the user to add important events to the daily planner so that time can be managed effectively. The planner displays the current day at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. The timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can click into one of the timeblocks and enter an event to be saved for that timeblock. The text for that even is saved to local storage and will persist even when the page is refreshed.
